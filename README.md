# A Simplified Bot for TicketMaster

This is a super simple bot for ticket master website and it only does a limited number of things. The script is adapted based on [https://github.com/spikeruk/TicketmasterBot](https://github.com/spikeruk/TicketmasterBot)

### **Note**

1. This bot should only be used for personal or educational purpose.
2. You may get banned from TicketMaster based on my personal experience
3. The script is only tried in Chrome console. Ensure the code is run in console on the event details page(i.e https://ticketmaster.sg/activity/detail/xxxxxx)

### **What it does**

- Refresh the event detail page till the 'Buy Tickets' button is available
- Click on the 'Find Tickets' button on a specified session (Modify the input session on line 61)
